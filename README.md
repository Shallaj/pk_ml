# UC San Diego | AI-READI Bootcamp

This is a rigorous two-week immersive (100 hour) bootcamp. This bootcamp consists of a combination of didactic lectures and hands-on tutorials and lab exercises using Python. You will be introduced to a basic data science workflow, including software version control in GitHub, rapid prototyping and data visualization in Jupyter, statistical methods, data models, data wrangling/processing, and a brief introduction to machine learning and AI.

## BOOTCAMP OBJECTIVES
* Learn basic data science principles and pitfalls
* Learn how to use GitHub version control and project management tools
* Learn basic Python programming (including writing “Pythonic” code)
* Learn how to use Jupyter for prototyping and data visualization
* Learn how to use an integrated development environments (IDEs) for more formal software development
* Learn Python Pandas for working with larger datasets
* Learn statistics in Python: frequentist methods, non-parametric statistics, etc.
* Learn the basics of machine learning in Python: linear and logistic regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, decision trees, back propagation learning.
